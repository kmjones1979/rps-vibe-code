## Requirements

Before you begin, you need to install the following tools:

-   [Node (>= v20.18.3)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
-   Yarn ([v1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) or [v2+](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install))
-   [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Quickstart

To get started with Scaffold-ETH 2, follow the steps below:

1. Install dependencies if it was skipped in CLI:

```
cd my-dapp-example
yarn install
```

2. Run a local network in the first terminal:

```
yarn chain
```

This command starts a local Ethereum network using Hardhat. The network runs on your local machine and can be used for testing and development. You can customize the network configuration in `packages/hardhat/hardhat.config.ts`.

3. On a second terminal, deploy the test contract:

```
yarn deploy
```

This command deploys a test smart contract to the local network. The contract is located in `packages/hardhat/contracts` and can be modified to suit your needs. The `yarn deploy` command uses the deploy script located in `packages/hardhat/deploy` to deploy the contract to the network. You can also customize the deploy script.

4. On a third terminal, start your NextJS app:

```
yarn start
```

Visit your app on: `http://localhost:3000`. You can interact with your smart contract using the `Debug Contracts` page. You can tweak the app config in `packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts`.

Run smart contract test with `yarn hardhat:test`

-   Edit your smart contracts in `packages/hardhat/contracts`
-   Edit your frontend homepage at `packages/nextjs/app/page.tsx`. For guidance on [routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/defining-routes) and configuring [pages/layouts](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts) checkout the Next.js documentation.
-   Edit your deployment scripts in `packages/hardhat/deploy`

## Smart Contract Overview

The game is implemented in `YourContract.sol` using Solidity. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

### Enums and State Management

```solidity
enum GameState {
    WAITING,    // 0 - Game created, waiting for player 2
    COMMITTED,  // 1 - Both players committed their moves
    REVEALED,   // 2 - Both players revealed their moves
    COMPLETED   // 3 - Game finished, winner determined
}

enum Move {
    NONE,       // 0 - No move made yet
    ROCK,       // 1 - Rock move
    PAPER,      // 2 - Paper move
    SCISSORS    // 3 - Scissors move
}

enum GameResult {
    NONE,           // 0 - No result yet
    PLAYER1_WIN,    // 1 - Player 1 won
    PLAYER2_WIN,    // 2 - Player 2 won
    DRAW            // 3 - Game was a draw
}
```

### Game Struct

```solidity
struct Game {
    address player1;
    address player2;
    GameState state;
    bytes32 player1Commitment;
    bytes32 player2Commitment;
    Move player1Move;
    Move player2Move;
    GameResult result;
    uint256 betAmount;
}
```

### Key Functions

1. **Creating a Game**

```solidity
function createGame(uint256 betAmount) external payable {
    require(msg.value >= MIN_BET, "Bet amount too low");
    require(msg.value == betAmount, "Incorrect bet amount");

    games[gameCount] = Game({
        player1: msg.sender,
        player2: address(0),
        state: GameState.WAITING,
        player1Commitment: bytes32(0),
        player2Commitment: bytes32(0),
        player1Move: Move.NONE,
        player2Move: Move.NONE,
        result: GameResult.NONE,
        betAmount: betAmount
    });

    emit GameCreated(gameCount, msg.sender, betAmount);
    gameCount++;
}
```

2. **Joining a Game**

```solidity
function joinGame(uint256 gameId) external payable {
    Game storage game = games[gameId];
    require(game.state == GameState.WAITING, "Game not available");
    require(msg.value == game.betAmount, "Incorrect bet amount");

    game.player2 = msg.sender;
    game.state = GameState.COMMITTED;
    emit GameJoined(gameId, msg.sender);
}
```

3. **Committing a Move**

```solidity
function commitMove(uint256 gameId, bytes32 commitment) external onlyPlayers(gameId) {
    Game storage game = games[gameId];
    require(game.state == GameState.COMMITTED, "Game not in commit phase");

    if (msg.sender == game.player1 && game.player1Commitment == bytes32(0)) {
        game.player1Commitment = commitment;
    } else if (msg.sender == game.player2 && game.player2Commitment == bytes32(0)) {
        game.player2Commitment = commitment;
    } else {
        revert("Not your turn or already committed");
    }

    emit MoveCommitted(gameId, msg.sender);

    if (game.player1Commitment != bytes32(0) && game.player2Commitment != bytes32(0)) {
        game.state = GameState.REVEALED;
    }
}
```

4. **Revealing a Move**

```solidity
function revealMove(uint256 gameId, Move move, bytes32 salt) external onlyPlayers(gameId) {
    Game storage game = games[gameId];
    require(game.state == GameState.REVEALED, "Game not in reveal phase");
    require(move != Move.NONE, "Invalid move");

    bytes32 commitment = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(move, salt, msg.sender));

    if (msg.sender == game.player1) {
        require(commitment == game.player1Commitment, "Invalid commitment");
        game.player1Move = move;
    } else {
        require(commitment == game.player2Commitment, "Invalid commitment");
        game.player2Move = move;
    }

    emit MoveRevealed(gameId, msg.sender, move);

    if (game.player1Move != Move.NONE && game.player2Move != Move.NONE) {
        _determineWinner(gameId);
    }
}
```

## Frontend Implementation

The frontend is built with React and uses Scaffold-ETH 2's custom hooks for blockchain interaction.

### Key Components

1. **Game Interface**

```typescript
interface Game {
    id: bigint;
    player1: `0x${string}`;
    player2: `0x${string}`;
    state: number;
    player1Commitment: string;
    player2Commitment: string;
    player1Move: number;
    player2Move: number;
    result: number;
    betAmount: bigint;
}
```

2. **Contract Interaction Hooks**

```typescript
// Reading game count
const { data: gameCount } = useScaffoldReadContract({
    contractName: "YourContract",
    functionName: "gameCount",
    watch: true,
});

// Writing to contract
const { writeContractAsync: createGame } = useScaffoldWriteContract({
    contractName: "YourContract",
});
```

3. **Event Handling**

```typescript
useScaffoldWatchContractEvent({
    contractName: "YourContract",
    eventName: "MoveRevealed",
    onLogs: (logs) => {
        logs.forEach((log) => {
            if (log.args?.gameId && log.args?.player && log.args?.move) {
                console.log(`üéØ Move revealed: ${Move[Number(log.args.move)]}`);
            }
        });
    },
});
```

## Game Flow

1. **Game Creation**

    - Player 1 creates a game with a bet amount
    - Game starts in WAITING state

2. **Game Joining**

    - Player 2 joins the game with matching bet amount
    - Game transitions to COMMITTED state

3. **Move Commitment**

    - Both players commit their moves using a hash of their move + salt
    - Game transitions to REVEALED state when both commitments are made

4. **Move Revelation**

    - Players reveal their moves by providing the original move and salt
    - Contract verifies the commitment matches
    - Game transitions to COMPLETED state when both moves are revealed

5. **Winner Determination**
    - Contract determines winner based on Rock Paper Scissors rules
    - Winner receives both bets
    - In case of a draw, bets are returned to both players

## Security Considerations

1. **Commit-Reveal Pattern**

    - Players commit to their moves before revealing them
    - Prevents players from changing their moves based on opponent's choice
    - Uses keccak256 hash function for commitment generation

2. **State Management**

    - Clear state transitions prevent invalid operations
    - Each state has specific allowed actions
    - Proper checks ensure game integrity

3. **Bet Handling**
    - Exact bet amount matching required
    - Secure transfer of funds to winner
    - Draw handling returns funds to both players
